Welcome to Akash Restaurant - Order Menu System (Version 1)

This program is an interactive order-taking system designed for a restaurant setup. 

It allows customers to :----------

View the menu with prices.
Place orders for available items (Maggi, Kulfi, Pizza, Burger).
Add more items to their order if desired.
Confirm their final order or cancel it altogether.
Get the total amount to be paid at the end.


How it works :---------------------

The menu is displayed with prices, and customers can input their first order.
If the order is valid, it gets added to the bill; otherwise, the system prompts the user to re-enter.
Customers are asked if theyâ€™d like to add more items, and the process repeats as needed.
Finally, they confirm their total bill or cancel their order.
Note:
This is Version 1 of the system, so it may have some limitations or areas needing improvement. 
Future updates will make the system more user-friendly and robust. 

Your feedback is highly appreciated as I work on refining it!
